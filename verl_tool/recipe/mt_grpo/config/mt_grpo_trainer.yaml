# MT-GRPO Trainer Configuration
# Inherits from verl_tool's ppo_trainer.yaml and adds turn-level credit assignment

defaults:
  # Inherit from verl_tool's base ppo trainer config
  - /verl_tool/trainer/config/ppo_trainer
  - _self_

# MT-GRPO specific algorithm settings
algorithm:
  # Advantage estimator - set to mt_grpo for turn-level credit assignment
  adv_estimator: mt_grpo

  # Coefficient for turn advantage in tool calling phase
  # Tool phase: advantage = outcome_adv + turn_advantage_coef * turn_adv
  # Answer phase: advantage = outcome_adv
  turn_advantage_coef: 1.0

  # GRPO settings (no std normalization to match original MT-GRPO)
  norm_adv_by_std_in_grpo: False
